webstats
========

Very simple webserver statistics program.

It shows graphs and stats from a sliding window of the last 31 days
and optionaly from yesterday.

You should be able to see a live sample at http://seanm.ca/stats/.

For a much more full featured webstat program I recommend the
Webalizer: http://www.webalizer.org/.
